# Amass

## All-Inclusive Social Media Messaging

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assemblymade.com/amass](https://assemblymade.com/amass).

## Getting Started

[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) is the recommended way to run Amass on your own machine. You need to download and install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/downloads) before you can continue (this will take a while to run so you may want to grab some coffee).

    git clone https://github.com/asm-products/amass.git amass
    cd amass
    vagrant up

Once it's finished open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to check out Amass.

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
